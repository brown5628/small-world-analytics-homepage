How often are Supreme Court nominees confirmed once nominated? What does this figure look like conditional on the Senate and Presidency both being held by the same party?\n","2. What is the mortality rate for on average person that fits Barrett's demographics?\n","3. How long does the nomination process usually take?\n","\n","From a more qualitative read of the process, based on public statements the following things seem relevant:\n","\n","- The votes exist to confirm.\n","- Senate Leader says this will happen before the election.\n","- Senate Minority Leader says they will try to slow this down procedurally as much as possible.\n","### Reference Classes\n","The Senate has a list of all SCOTUS nominations and thier outcomes [here](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nominations/SupremeCourtNominations1789present.htm). Of 163 nominations for the Court, 126 were confirmed. Some that were confirmed declined to serve, but that is irrelevant to the question. This [Congressional Research Service report](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20160316_IN10458_798cc145841968d0dc9b74f1c3ff9d143f7012f6.pdf) breaks down nomination outcomes by party control from 1946-2016. Adjusting for the 2 SCOTUS nomination processes post-2016, when a party controls both the Senate and the Presidency 19 out of 22 nominations were confirmed. Conditioning on undivided government and the past ~century seems more appropriate here.\n","\n","According to [this data pull from the CDC](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D76;jsessionid=7C5F0B56D47CB8962015E7F22182), the average national mortality rate for a 48 year old white woman between 1999 and 2018 was ~.002. Very low, would not expect this to weigh heavily on the calc.\n","\n","Per [this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/how-long-to-confirm-supreme-court-justice.html), since 1975 only 3 successful confirmations have occured in the time window between nomination and the election (39 days). This seems like an accurate representation of the past but do not believe it to hold as much weight given the current political context.\n","### Other Sources\n","- Predictit is about ~87% that the confirmation vote will happen before the election.\n","### Model(s)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"0.7493924175722072"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":1}],"source":["undivided_gov_nomination = 19/22\n","general_mortality = 1-(3550/1353143)\n","confirmation_window = .87\n","\n","undivided_gov_nomination * general_mortality * confirmation_window\n",""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Prediction\n","Adjusting the references classes upwards due to the context names above moves a ~75% to an ~85%."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Revision 1\n","*Updated 2020-10-04*\n","### Comments\n","No major updates to the core thought process, but multiple Republican Senators coming down with COVID-19 appear to have made it more unlikely that the confirmation will not be able to happen within the accelerated schedule.\n","\n","In hindsight, don't think the math of the original prediction works with the inclusion of Predictit since it is double counting data. Revising to take that into account, and flagging that there has to be a better way of doing this.\n","\n","Going to feed in a personal belief as to how confident I am that they can do it fast enough (2/3). Also going to express my belief that this nominee is more likely than others to be confirmed via the model rather than a post model adjustment.
